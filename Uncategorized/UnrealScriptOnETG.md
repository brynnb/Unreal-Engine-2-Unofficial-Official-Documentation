## Live People to Grouse With

An unofficial UnrealScript discussion channel is maintained on the EnterTheGame IRC network.<irc://irc.enterthegame.com:6667/UnrealScript>Broken down for you:

* **Server:** irc.enterthegame.com
* **Port:** 6667 (default)
* **Channel:** #UnrealScript

## Channel Rules

This is a channel for serious, technical UnrealScript-related discussion. There is a very low tolerance for off-topic discussion. There are other channels to discuss \*nix, C++, video games, etc. Ops will ban you if you can not comply.

* **NO** pasting code in channel. Instead, use: <http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/ScratchPad>
* **NO** mod recruitment.
* **NO** warez.
* **NO** IRC scripts.
* **NO** off-topic chat.
* **NO** whining about how "easy" it is to "steal" your UnrealScript code. Your code isn't worth it. This includes discussion on stripping the plaintext UnrealScript code out of your packages.
* **NO** whining about how your idea is too unique to discuss in public. It isn't. This include asking people if you can privately message them your questions, particularly ops.

Just ask your question, and be patient. No-one in the channel lives to answer your question, and you don't need permission to ask. Just ask your question, and sit around all day until someone decides to answer you. If you're not there when someone knows the answer, you'll never hear it.

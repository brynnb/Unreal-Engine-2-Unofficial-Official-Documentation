## If You Have an Idea

Unfortunately, we cannot accept unsolicited game submissions - design, programming, art, or otherwise.If you feel that your idea is a good one and would like to see it implemented, please consider mod development using an Unreal-powered game such as Unreal Tournament or Gears of War. You can recruit people - programmers, artists, etc. - from the Unreal mod development community to help you realize your idea. There are many teams that this has worked out for, in many different ways!Best of luck in your endeavors.

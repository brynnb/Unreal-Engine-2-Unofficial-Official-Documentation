Welcome to the UE3 section of this documentation, with all the details you need to become an expert with the award-winning [Unreal Technology](http://www.unrealtechnology.com) including Unreal Engine 3 and [Unreal Development Kit (UDK)](http://udk.com).UE3 was the leading engine of the previous generation, but has been improved upon by the [Unreal Engine 4 technology](https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4). Teams who are already developing with UE3 are welcome to continue development and utilize the information provided here; however for new projects, we recommend UE4.Content on this site is not maintained, and may be outdated.

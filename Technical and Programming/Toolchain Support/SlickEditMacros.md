## Features

These macros add the ability for Slickedit to do context tagging and lexer(Syntax Highlighting) support for Unrealscript.

## Installation

Read the uc\_install.txt file for instructions.

## Troubleshooting

I am still working on these macros to improve them, so if you run into any problems or bugs please let me know.[mjt@pipedreaminteractive.com](mailto:mjt@pipedreaminteractive.com)

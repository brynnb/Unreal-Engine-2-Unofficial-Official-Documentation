# Unreal Engine 2 Unofficial Documentation Archive

This repository contains a complete, cleaned, and organized archive of the official Unreal Engine 2 (UE2) / Unreal Development Kit (UDK) documentation.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this archive are:

1.  **Archival Preservation:** Ensuring this legacy documentation remains accessible in a standard, future-proof format (Markdown).
2.  **Ease of Access:** Providing a browsable, offline-ready folder structure for developers working with legacy Unreal Engine versions.
3.  **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** The files have been specifically cleaned (headers, footers, and navigation noise removed)

## Source & Modifications

The content was originally crawled from the [legacy Unreal Engine 2 documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/udk/Two/SiteMap.html).

**Modifications made:**
*   Converted original HTML to Markdown.
*   Downloaded and locally linked all image assets.
*   Cleaned unnecessary navigation headers, sidebars, and footers.

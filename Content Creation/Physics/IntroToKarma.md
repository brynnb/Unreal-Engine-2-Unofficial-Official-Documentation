## Karma Reference

The [KarmaReference](KarmaReference.md) document is a comprehensive guide to all of the features of KarmaActors including removing Karma Integration, activating Karma, explanations of each of the Karma Properties, explanations of KConstraint properties, and tips for debugging Karma and creating good simulations.

## Importing Karma Actors

The [ImportingKarmaActors](../../Uncategorized/ImportingKarmaActors.md) document contains a ready made KarmaActor (both in .ASE and .MAX file formats) that you can download and import into your own build. The document also provides explanations on how to create your own Karma Actors using 3rd party modeling programs (such as 3DS Max).

## Using Karma Actors

The [UsingKarmaActors](../../Uncategorized/UsingKarmaActors.md) document contains an additional example KarmaActor (both in .ASE and .MAX file formats) that you can download and import into your own build. This document focuses more on how to set up KActors with constraints.

## Ragdolls in UT2003

The [RagdollsInUT2003](../../Uncategorized/RagdollsInUT2003.md) document briefly talks about how KAT was used to set up ragdoll physics for the characters in UT2003.

## Karma Example Maps

The following documents are example maps that demonstrate how to use Karma in your levels.

### Karma Colosseum

In the [ExampleMapsKarmaColosseum](../../Uncategorized/ExampleMapsKarmaColosseum.md) document, you will see how to create a variety of Karma Objects ranging from simple Karma primitives, to more complex objects made of multiple parts including KConstraints and destructible geometry.

### Karma Example UT2003

The [KarmaExampleUT2003](../../Uncategorized/KarmaExampleUT2003.md) document shows how Karma can be used to create a catapult, swinging door, and a rotating fan with dangling poles. While the map only works with UT2003, its principles should still hold true in a current build of Unreal.
